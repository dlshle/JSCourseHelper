	https://enroll.wisc.edu/api/planner/v1/roadmap/TERM_CODE(acquire all courses in cart)
	for each courseId, query https://enroll.wisc.edu/api/search/v1/enrollmentPackages/TERM_CODE/subjectCode/courseId (acquire all sections in detail)

For terms:
A list of terms available. Term code is important for acquiring advanced information of the students desired courses(course in cart&course enrolled)

For roadmap/TERM_CODE
A list of courses in cart, detailed information about individual course can be found by:
for all courses c in list:
	query q = https://enroll.wisc.edu/api/search/v1/enrollmentPackages/c.termCode/c.subjectCode/c.courseId
	allCourses.put(c.details.courseDesignation, q)

For each queried course(https://enroll.wisc.edu/api/search/v1/enrollmentPackages/TERM_CODE/subjectCode/courseId)
A list of elements.

		classMeetings = [] {building:{buildingName, streetAddress}, examDate, meetingDays("M/T/...")<--can be multiple like MW--!>, meetingTimeStart, meetingTimeEnd, room, meetingType("CLASS"/"EXAM")},
		//get building info + room and meetingTimeStart/End. If its exam, only needs examDate; If not, needs meetingDays.

Research:
Check meetingTime and meetingDate mechanism:

/1000/60 : 1160-1210(minutes)	
/60:%60 : 19:20 20:10
